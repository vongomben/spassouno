# (S)passoUno

(S)passoUno is a [Processing](https://processing.org/) sketch patched on Alexandre Quessy's 
[ToonLoop](http://www.toonloop.com/) project. Among the [many versions](http://www.toonloop.com/?q=download) 
of the program you can donwload from the official ToonLoop Site there is a
[processing sketch](https://bitbucket.org/aalex/toonloop-lite/) that has been used and
customized several times by Davide Gomba and Mirco Piccin in several Ardunio/Processing Workshops between 2012-2014. 

(S)passoUno waves his respect and legacy to ToonLoop, while being a physical implementation of it. 

You can find instructions on how to build/customize your board,
 as well as adding an [Arduino Leonardo](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLeonardo) 
 playing as [HID](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/MouseKeyboard) and some buttons as an interface.

Processing has changed a lot in the last years, so the version of ToonLoop program is updated to the 
latest libraries, bypassing the new video export of Processing as well as changing several stuff in sequence Array.
